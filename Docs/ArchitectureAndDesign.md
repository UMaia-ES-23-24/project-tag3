UResults gets sports information from different api calls, the user may subscribe to any sport so that he may receive the information directly on his home. 

The user navigates the app through a user interface created in flutter and searches for a sport that interests him. When a sport is selected a API call relevant to the selected subject is made. If the API call is successful the app should display the information right away, allowing the user to search for more details, favorite the sport by doing a long press or watch the match in a video player in case the sport supports that. 

Any subscriptions should be stored locally, and the user should be able to unsubscribe to the sport with a long press in the home section.
