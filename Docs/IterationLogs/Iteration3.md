## What went well?

- Every issue was correctly concluded this time!  


## What should we do differently?

- Some of our chosen apis ended up being useless because of paywalls or just poor quality which resulted in last minute changes to the sports

## What still puzzles me?
    
- We were unable to make a leaderboard for all sports since a lot of apis paywall features like scoring

- There might be a way to use a twitch/bili bili video player but we are still unsure of how to do it
