## What went well?

- Every issue was correctly concluded?
	- No, not every issue was concluded. The main sport page does not gather information from the API
	
- GitHub Flow went smoothly?
	- Yes, dividing tasks into smaller tasks allowed for better work division

- Code revisions went well?
	- No, since flutterflow allowed only one user at all times, most work was done alone.
- Only 3 members worked on the project
	- All assingments were done by only three members, sprint could have been more ambitious and done earlier if all members were on board.

## What should we do differently?

- Had a better grasp at API CALLS, used a better API from the start, a lot of work required a student premium account to be possible.


## What still puzzles me?

- A lot of areas like "Odds" and "Statistics" are very api / sport dependent, a better template for general sports could have been done to fit all sports.
