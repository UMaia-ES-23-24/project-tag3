## What went well?

- Every issue was correctly concluded this time!  
- This time more than one member could work on flutterflow at the same time so the process went smoothly.

## What should we do differently?

- Now that we can use more than 2 api calls, some calls could have been changed for more specific ones.

## What still puzzles me?

- With the current number of students working it will be hard to make every other sport category by hand.
    
- favorites were made in a way that only saves the name because we couldn't figure out how to do a list that would update a container with different variables.

- Video player only works with youtube links
